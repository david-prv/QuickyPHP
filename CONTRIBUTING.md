# Contributing to Quicky

Please feel free to contribute to this project. I am always happy to see new and fresh ideas.

## Coding rules:

We want QuickyPHP to stay easily readable and extensible. To ensure this, we use a bunch of static analysis tools which help us to improve the code quality.
Any proposed pull request has to fullfill the requirements, as stated in our code style ruleset. These include, for example:  
- 4 spaces indent
- `elseif` instead of `else if`
- spaces before conditional parenthesises
- function brackets to the next line
- ... and much more!

## Security policy:

You have found an issue or even a dangerous vulnerability? Thank you for choosing the light side of the force! That's also a way of contribution. You can report your issue
by simply sending us an e-mail (do not open an issue on github for reporting vulnerabilities!).
