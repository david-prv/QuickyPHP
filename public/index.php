| Run Your Application

|
| To make your application working fine, you need
| to register routes. Routes can contain RegEx patterns, named
| variables and wildcards. Here, we just add the index route for
| your application, such that https://your-domain.tld/ maps to your
| defined callback behaviour.
|
| To do so, we import a pre-defined default bootstrap.
| Feel free to discover all available bootstraps in /bootstrap.
| I am also always happy to see new proposals for new ones.
|
| The last line then ignites the Core of QuickyPHP, where requests
| are going to be routed and processed, middleware going to be
| executed and the application will work.
